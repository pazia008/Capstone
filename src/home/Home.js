        <p>Whether it be for work or vacation purposes, my family has always been on the move. Growing up, I never lived in the same house for longer than four years before needing to move again for my dadâ€™s work. With all the traveling my family has done, I have learned a thing or two about preparing and packing for trips. 
        I wanted to create a web application that would help me plan and thoroughly think about trips or vacations I plan on taking. My family would always get extremely stressed when it came to the planning process of our expeditions, so I wanted to help relieve some stress on users of my app and my future self.
